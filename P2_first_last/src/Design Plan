Design Plan - P2
Due: 3/12/25 11:59pm

1) Reading the specs - understand the problem
2) Understand the map-based input files
	- @ = wall
	- . = empty tile
	- $ = end goal (buck)
	- W = character; wolverine
	- | = open walkway
	- Note that character (W) is never allowed to move diagonal, only up, down, left or right.
3) Understand the coordinate system
	- (Row, Col, Maze Level)
		EX: $ 2 2 0 (Buck is @ the second row, second column and on the 0th level.)
4) Code 3 different approaches, one using Stack, one using Queue, and one using any way
   to find the most optimal path to the buck or pathway
5) Output/input the file in one of two ways
	- Coordinate System
6) Measure runtime
